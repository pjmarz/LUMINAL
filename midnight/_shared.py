"""
Shared helpers inlined into every Midnight tool by build_tools.py.

This module is the SOURCE OF TRUTH. Do not edit the copies that appear at the
top of midnight/dist/*.py — those are regenerated from this file. Edit here,
then run `python3 midnight/build_tools.py` to regenerate dist/.

Why inline rather than import: OpenWebUI uploads each tool as a single .py
file via the Workspace UI. Cross-file imports between tools are not part of
that workflow, so the build script copies these helpers into each tool's
distributed file. The original templates in midnight/midnight_*.py carry
the marker `# {{INLINE_SHARED}}` where the inlined block goes.
